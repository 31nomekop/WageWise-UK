      <h2>What is WageWise?</h2>
      <p class="fine">
        WageWise UK is a simple tool that helps you estimate your take-home pay for the UK tax year shown in the app.
        It supports annual salary and hourly pay, and includes common deductions such as Income Tax, National Insurance,
        student loan repayments, and pension contributions.
      </p>

      <h2>Who is it for?</h2>
      <p class="fine">
        Anyone paid through PAYE who wants a clearer picture of what they will take home — especially if you work variable hours,
        do overtime, or need to estimate your annual salary from payslips.
      </p>

      <h2>What it does not do</h2>
      <p class="fine">
        WageWise is an estimator. Real payslips may differ due to payroll periods, benefits, adjustments to tax codes,
        workplace pension rules, and other factors.
